# Unit 2 Assessment - JavaScript Fundamentals
## Written Assessment

1. **What is hoisting? Describe how hoisting affects variable _and_ function declarations. Provide code snippets to illustrate hoisting for both.** 


2. **Why does the following block of code throw an error?**
  ```javascript
  const isMaya = true;

  if (isMaya) {
    let currentStatus = 'Everything is just fine';
  } else {
    let currentStatus = 'Time to panic.'
  }

  console.log(currentStatus);
  ```


3. **Why does the following block of code NOT throw an error?**
  ```javascript
  const isLaishaOnTime = true;

  if (isLaishaOnTime) {
    var currentStatus = 'Everything is just fine';
  } else {
    var currentStatus = 'Time to panic.'
  }

  console.log(currentStatus);
  ```



4. **In JavaScript, we can declare variables with `var`, `let`, and `const`. What are the differences between each? Be sure to comment on how each declaration impacts the _scope_, _reassignment_, and _hoisting_ of variables.**




5. **What does the following code log? Explain why?**
  ```javascript
  let bestPlayer = {name: "Lebron James"};
  let theGOAT = bestPlayer;
  bestPlayer.name = "Kevin Durant";
  console.log(theGOAT.name);
  ```

6. **What is the value of `b` after this code runs? Explain why this is the case.**
  ```javascript
  let a = 10;
  let b = a;
  a += 10;

  console.log(a);
  console.log(b);
  ```

7. **Where does the following code throw an error? What type of error? Why?**
  ```javascript
  const bffs = 'Enmanuel Laisha';
  bffs = 'Enmanuel Laisha Cielo';

  console.log(bffs);
  ```

8. **Wait, why doesn't the code below throw an error?! 🧐 What does this demonstrate?**
  ```javascript
  const bffs = ['Enmanuel', 'Laisha'];
  bffs.push('Cielo');

  console.log(bffs);
  ```


9. **What is the purpose of _rest parameters_? How do we use them? Explain how do they differ from the `arguments` object. Illustrate the use of rest parameters by writing a function that takes any number of integers as arguments and returns their sum.**

  ```javascript
  sum(1, 2, 10); // 13
  sum(5); // 5
  sum(100, 200, 800, 1, 1, 1); // 1103;
  ```


10. **What does the following code log? Why?**
  ```javascript
  let theCreator = 'Devonte';

  function shoutOut() {
    theCreator = 'Peter';
    console.log(`The best designer in the room is ${theCreator}.`);
  }

  shoutOut();
  console.log(`The best designer in the room is ${theCreator}.`);
  ```


11. **What does the following code log? Why?**
  ```javascript
  let theHustler = 'Laisha';

  function shoutOut() {
    let theHustler = `Paul`;
    console.log(`${theHustler} is the hardest working person in the room.`);
  }

  shoutOut();
  console.log(`${theHustler} is also the hardest working person in the room.`);
  ```

12. **What do we mean when we say that JavaScript passes variables _by value_?**


13. **What does it mean to _pass by reference_? In what ways do arrays and objects appear to be passed by reference in JavaScript? Use a code snippet to demonstrate.**
